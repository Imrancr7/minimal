# Data Fraud Alert Project Documentation - Imran Wadrali
## Overview
The **Data Fraud Alert Project** is designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in data transactions. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and customizable rules, the system provides real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and comprehensive reporting to mitigate risks effectively.
---
## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks data transactions for suspicious activities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Employs machine learning models to identify deviations from normal patterns.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows users to define specific rules for flagging potential fraud cases.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports for further analysis and decision-making.
---
## Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Visualization Tools**: D3.js, Matplotlib

## Usage Instructions
1. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Upload your dataset for analysis.
3. Review flagged transactions and detailed reports.
---
## Example Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing transaction details.
2. **Model Training**: Train an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies.
3. **Fraud Detection**: Flag transactions identified as fraudulent.
4. **Reporting**: Generate a report for further analysis.
